# SimPPL and the change.

[SimPPL](https://simppl.org) is a student run research organization that works on civic integrity and misinformation mitigatin projects. It is backed by the Mozilla Foundation, Anti Defamaiton League (ADL), Google Research and many more. It was founded by Dr. Swapneel Mehta, post-doc at MIT-Boston University. Will get back to Swapneel later in the blog.

> [!TIP]
> We at SimPPL are actively loking for interns. And are currently running a fellowship programme. If you are interssted in working with us, please visit our [website](https://simppl.org/fellowships) for more details. Btw, I built the website, lmk if you like it. üòÅ

Okay enough of the promotion. Let's get back to the blog.

SimPPL, how the hell did I get in tuch with this organization in New York, when I am sitting right here in India? It all started from a Hackathon I participated in. It was the most famous hackathons of TSEC, aka TSEC Hacks 2023. I was in my third year and it was one of my earliest hackathon where my team chose AI/ML as the domain. Hackathon day started, problem statements were out. We were set to work on a difficult at the same time unique ps that we never heard of. The PS had giant terms such as Co-ordinated Behaviour, misinformation, fact checked, disinformation, Bot activity, propaganda detection, credibility score and a lot more. We were like, "What the h is this?" We are not even aware of these terms. Did we make a wrong decision by choosing this PS? We were in a dilemma. But we decided to go ahead with it. We started researching on the terms and the problem statement. Fortunte enough, back then ChatGPT was launched just a few months before the hackathon üòâ (if yk yk).

But Archit what is the relation between SimPPL and the hackathon? I am coming to that. Just hold on.
The problem statement was sponsored by SimPPL and the catch was the winning team will get an internship opportunity at SimPPL. Guess what? We won the hackathon? No. We didn't. We didn't even make it to the top 10 üò¢. But we were so much into the PS that we finally created this amazing website that has around 5000 scraped articles on which we do propaganda detection and analysis, bot activity detection, truthfulness scores and alot more [here](https://github.com/Archit1706/SocialVision). Using the Twitter dataset we also did tweet analysis on each news article, detecting how the article was shared by twitter users, creating a network to propagate falsehoods. We didn't make it to the top 10 as there were only two teams who selected this PS and only one team could have proceeded to the Finals. As per the judges, we didn't make it as our UI was not that good, while the other made it as they threy a 10 differnt colors on the screen to make their website just colorful. Okay, I am not bitching just laying down the facts. üòÇ Congratulation to that team tho!

Again Archit how did you get in touch with SimPPL? I am coming to that. Just hold on. üòÇ
At the end of the hackathon SimPPL asked all the teams that worked on the PS to submit a PPt documenting our work and ideas from the hackathon. Well call it karma, luck or just hard work, Swapneel Liked our PPT, ideas and motivation more than the winning teams. Thus, you know the rest. We got the internship opportunity at SimPPL.

As a reserach engineer at SimPPL, when I joined there were multiple projects in their starting or just ideation stage. Since back then the team was small we were free to join any existing project or pick up a project from the ideas. Well I picked up a project that was in the ideation stage. The project was to create a platform that can detect and mitigate misinformation in the form of images and videos.
