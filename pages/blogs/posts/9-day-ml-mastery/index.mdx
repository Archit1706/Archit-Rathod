Let's start with **Day 1**! ðŸš€

### **Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning - Detailed Plan**

## **1. Theory & Notes**

Before diving into coding, start by understanding the core concepts of machine learning.

### **What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### **Types of Machine Learning**

-   **Supervised Learning**: Model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
    -   **Example**: Predicting house prices based on past sales data.
-   **Unsupervised Learning**: Model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
    -   **Example**: Clustering customers based on shopping behavior.
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: Model learns through rewards and penalties.
    -   **Example**: Training an AI to play chess.

### **Common ML Algorithms**

-   **Supervised Learning**:
    -   Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
    -   Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks
-   **Unsupervised Learning**:
    -   Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN
    -   Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
-   **Reinforcement Learning**:
    -   Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN)

### **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**

-   **Bias**: Model makes strong assumptions, leading to underfitting.
-   **Variance**: Model is too complex and captures noise, leading to overfitting.
-   **Goal**: Find a balance between the two.

### **Evaluation Metrics for Supervised Learning**

-   **Classification**:

    -   Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
    -   Precision = TP / (TP + FP) â†’ How many selected items are relevant?
    -   Recall = TP / (TP + FN) â†’ How many relevant items are selected?
    -   F1-Score = 2 Ã— (Precision Ã— Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
    -   ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve): Measures the performance across thresholds.

-   **Regression**:
    -   Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    -   Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    -   RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

---

## **2. Technical Stuff - Setting Up Environment**

Make sure you have the required libraries installed.

### **Install Python & Essential Libraries**

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### **Start Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once the Jupyter Notebook opens, you can start coding in interactive cells.

## **3. Hands-on Project: Titanic Dataset EDA**

### **Dataset: Titanic Survival Prediction**

-   **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
-   **Goal**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
-   **Tasks**:
    1. Load the dataset.
    2. Explore missing values.
    3. Visualize distributions.
    4. Find correlations.

### **Code Template: Titanic EDA**

```python
# Importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load Dataset
titanic = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv")

# Display first 5 rows
titanic.head()
```

### **Step 1: Check Missing Values**

```python
# Check for missing values
titanic.isnull().sum()
```

### **Step 2: Handle Missing Values**

```python
# Fill missing Age with median
titanic['Age'].fillna(titanic['Age'].median(), inplace=True)

# Fill missing Embarked with most frequent value
titanic['Embarked'].fillna(titanic['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Drop Cabin column due to high missing values
titanic.drop(columns=['Cabin'], inplace=True)
```

### **Step 3: Data Distribution**

```python
# Visualizing Age distribution
sns.histplot(titanic['Age'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 4: Correlation Heatmap**

```python
# Check correlation between numerical features
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.heatmap(titanic.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title('Feature Correlation')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 5: Survival Rate by Gender**

```python
# Countplot of Survival based on Gender
sns.countplot(x='Survived', hue='Sex', data=titanic)
plt.title('Survival Rate by Gender')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 6: Conclusion from EDA**

-   Missing values were handled.
-   Older people had a different survival rate than younger passengers.
-   Women had a higher survival rate than men.
