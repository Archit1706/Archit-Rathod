# Menstruation 101: What Every Man Should Know

Why do I write this?

-   I am a single child of my parents. And have no sister with whom I can talk about this. Neither my parents had a comforable chat with me on this topic. A few days ago my friends and I were discussing about this and I realised that I knew nothing about this. So they gave me a good lecture about how menstruation works and other related details. Hearing them made me realize the importance of men to be educated with this topic.

So lets start with the basics.

## What is menstruation?

Menstruation, commonly known as a "period," is the monthly shedding of the uterine lining in females of reproductive age. It is a crucial part of the menstrual cycle, which typically lasts about 28 days but can vary among individuals. The menstrual cycle is governed by hormones and plays a significant role in a woman's reproductive health.

## What is the menstrual cycle?

The menstrual cycle is a roughly 28-day process that prepares a woman's body for pregnancy. It consists of several phases:

1. _**Menstruation (Day 1-5)**_: The start of the cycle is marked by menstruation, where the uterine lining is shed. This is when bleeding occurs.

2. _**Follicular Phase (Day 1-13)**_: The body prepares an egg for release from the ovaries.

3. _**Ovulation (Around Day 14)**_: The matured egg is released from the ovary, making it available for fertilization.

4. _**Luteal Phase (Day 15-28)**_: If the egg is not fertilized, the body prepares for another menstrual cycle. If fertilization occurs, it leads to pregnancy.

> Note: The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are produced by the ovaries and regulate the menstrual cycle. Thus, menstrual cycle is different for different women.

## What are the common symptoms?

During menstruation, many women experience a variety of symptoms, including:

1. _**Cramps**_: These are caused by uterine contractions and can vary in intensity.

2. _**Mood Swings**_: Hormonal changes can lead to mood swings and irritability.

3. _**Bloating**_: Some women may feel bloated or experience water retention.

{/* Breast Tenderness: Hormonal fluctuations can cause breast discomfort. */}

## So how do women maintain hygeine?

Women use menstrual products, like pads, tampons, menstrual cups, or period underwear, to manage their flow. It's important to dispose of these products properly and maintain good hygiene during menstruation.

## How can we as men help?

Understanding menstruation is an essential aspect of supporting the women in your life. Here are some ways to be supportive:

1. _**Be Empathetic**_: Be understanding and empathetic when women experience discomfort or mood swings during their period.

2. _**Offer Help**_: If possible, offer assistance with tasks and chores to ease the burden during this time.

3. _**Educate Yourself**_: Take the time to learn about menstruation to better understand what women go through.

I urge each and every men as well as women out there to break this taboo and be open to hear, share, learn and discuss about these topics. It is not a shame to talk about this. It is a natural process and we should be open to talk about it.
