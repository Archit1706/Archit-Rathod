## SQL Recap

### Basic SQL Queries

1. **Retrieve All Data**:  
   Write a query to retrieve all records from a table `employees`.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT * FROM employees;
    ```

2. **Filter Rows Based on Condition**:  
   Write a query to get all employees who have a salary greater than 5000.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;
    ```

3. **Sort Data**:  
   Write a query to get all employees sorted by their hire date in descending order.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
    ```

4. **Aggregate Function**:  
   Write a query to get the average salary of all employees.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees;
    ```

5. **GROUP BY**:  
   Write a query to get the total salary paid by each department.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id;
    ```

6. **HAVING Clause**:  
   Write a query to get departments where the total salary exceeds 100,000.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;
    ```

7. **INNER JOIN**:  
   Write a query to get employee names along with their department names (use tables `employees` and `departments`).

    ```sql copy
    SELECT e.name, d.department_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```

8. **LEFT JOIN**:  
   Write a query to get all departments along with the names of employees working in those departments (if any).

    ```sql copy
    SELECT d.department_name, e.name
    FROM departments d
    LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
    ```

9. **COUNT Function**:  
   Write a query to count the number of employees in each department.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id;
    ```

10. **DISTINCT Values**:  
    Write a query to find all unique job titles from the employees' table.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT DISTINCT job_title
    FROM employees;
    ```

### Intermediate SQL Queries

11. **Subqueries**:  
    Write a query to get the names of employees who earn more than the average salary in the company.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT name
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
    ```

12. **Self JOIN**:  
    Write a query to find the employees who work under the same manager.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
    FROM employees e1
    JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
    ```

13. **CASE Statement**:  
    Write a query to categorize employees' salaries as 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High' based on the following:

    -   Salary < 3000: Low
    -   3000 ≤ Salary ≤ 7000: Medium
    -   Salary > 7000: High

    ```sql copy
    SELECT name,
           CASE
               WHEN salary < 3000 THEN 'Low'
               WHEN salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 7000 THEN 'Medium'
               ELSE 'High'
           END AS salary_category
    FROM employees;
    ```

14. **DATE Functions**:  
    Write a query to get the employees who were hired in the last 5 years.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date >= DATEADD(YEAR, -5, GETDATE());
    ```

15. **UPDATE Query**:  
    Write a query to increase the salary of all employees in the 'Sales' department by 10%.

    ```sql copy
    UPDATE employees
    SET salary = salary * 1.1
    WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
    ```

16. **DELETE Query**:  
    Write a query to delete all employees whose performance rating is below 3.

    ```sql copy
    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE performance_rating < 3;
    ```

17. **CREATE TABLE**:  
    Write a SQL statement to create a table `projects` with the following columns:

    -   project_id (INT, primary key)
    -   project_name (VARCHAR, not null)
    -   start_date (DATE)
    -   end_date (DATE)

    ```sql copy
    CREATE TABLE projects (
        project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        project_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        start_date DATE,
        end_date DATE
    );
    ```

18. **ALTER TABLE**:  
    Write a SQL query to add a new column `budget` (DECIMAL) to the `projects` table.

    ```sql copy
    ALTER TABLE projects
    ADD budget DECIMAL(10, 2);
    ```

19. **INSERT INTO**:  
    Write a SQL query to insert a new employee into the `employees` table.

    ```sql copy
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, hire_date, department_id)
    VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 6000, '2020-05-15', 2);
    ```

20. **UNION Operator**:  
    Write a SQL query to combine the list of employee names from the `employees` table and the list of customer names from a `customers` table.

    ```sql copy
    SELECT name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT name FROM customers;
    ```

### Advanced SQL Queries

21. **WITH Clause (CTE)**:  
    Write a SQL query using CTE to find the average salary by department and rank them in descending order.

    ```sql copy
    WITH dept_avg AS (
        SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM dept_avg ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
    ```

22. **Recursive Query**:  
    Write a recursive query to find the hierarchy of employees and their managers.

    ```sql copy
    WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
        SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id
        FROM employees
        WHERE manager_id IS NULL
        UNION ALL
        SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, eh.manager_id
        FROM employees e
        JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
    ```

23. **Window Functions**:  
    Write a query to calculate the running total of salaries ordered by hire date.

           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employees;
    ```

25. **DELETE with Subquery**:  
    Write a query to delete employees who have never worked on any project (assume a `projects_employees` table exists).

    ```sql copy
    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM projects_employees);
    ```

26. **EXISTS Clause**:  
    Write a query to find all employees who are working on at least one project.

    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id);
    ```

28. **UPDATE with JOIN**:  
    Write a query to increase the salary of employees who work on a 'Critical' project by 15%.

    FROM (
        SELECT name, department_id, salary,
               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
        FROM employees
    ) ranked_employees
    WHERE rank <= 3;
    ```

30. **PIVOT Query**:  
    Write a query to pivot the total salary paid by each department for each job title.

    ```sql copy
