# jQuery Prep

## Learning jQuery 101

### Basic Questions
1. **What is jQuery?**
   - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation.

2. **How do you include jQuery in your project?**
   - You can include jQuery by adding a `<script>` tag in your HTML, either linking to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a local file:
     ```html
     <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
     ```

3. **How do you select elements in jQuery?**
   - You can select elements using CSS-style selectors:
     ```javascript
     $("p") // Selects all <p> elements
     $("#id") // Selects an element with a specific id
     $(".class") // Selects elements with a specific class
     ```

4. **How do you handle events in jQuery?**
   - Use methods like `.click()`, `.on()`, or `.hover()` to bind events:
     ```javascript
     $("#button").click(function() {
       alert("Button clicked!");
     });
     ```

5. **How do you manipulate the DOM with jQuery?**
   - Use methods like `.html()`, `.text()`, `.append()`, and `.remove()`:
     ```javascript
     $("#element").html("New content");
     ```

### Intermediate Questions
1. **Explain the difference between `.on()` and `.bind()` in jQuery.**
   - `.on()` is more flexible and recommended for handling events, allowing delegation and handling events for dynamically added elements. `.bind()` is deprecated but was used for binding events to elements.

2. **What is event delegation in jQuery?**
   - Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event handler to a parent element instead of individual child elements. This is useful for dynamically added elements:
     ```javascript
     $("#parent").on("click", ".child", function() {
       alert("Child clicked!");
     });
     ```

3. **How can you perform animations with jQuery?**
   - Use methods like `.fadeIn()`, `.fadeOut()`, `.slideUp()`, and `.slideDown()`:
     ```javascript
     $("#element").fadeIn(1000); // Fades in the element over 1 second
     ```

4. **What are jQuery's utility functions?**
   - Functions like `$.each()`, `$.extend()`, and `$.ajax()` are utilities provided by jQuery:
     ```javascript
     $.each(array, function(index, value) {
       console.log(index, value);
     });
     ```

5. **Explain the concept of "chaining" in jQuery.**
   - Chaining allows multiple jQuery methods to be called, one after another, on the same elements:
     ```javascript
     $("#element").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
     ```

### Advanced Questions
1. **How does jQuery handle asynchronous operations?**
   - jQuery provides the `.ajax()` method for asynchronous requests, supporting various settings like `url`, `type`, `data`, and `success` callbacks:
     ```javascript
     $.ajax({
       url: "data.json",
       method: "GET",
       success: function(data) {
         console.log(data);
       }
     });
     ```

2. **What are jQuery plugins, and how do you create one?**
   - jQuery plugins extend jQuery's functionality. A basic plugin is created by defining a function on jQueryâ€™s prototype:
     ```javascript
     (function($) {
       $.fn.myPlugin = function() {
         return this.each(function() {
           // Plugin code here
         });
       };
     })(jQuery);
     ```

3. **What is the purpose of `$.Deferred()` and how is it used?**
   - `$.Deferred()` is used for managing asynchronous operations, providing a way to handle success, failure, and progress of async tasks:
     ```javascript
     var deferred = $.Deferred();
     deferred.done(function() {
       console.log("Completed!");
     });
     deferred.resolve();
     ```

4. **Explain how jQuery's `$.when()` function works.**
   - `$.when()` is used to handle multiple deferred objects, ensuring that all of them are completed before executing a callback:
     ```javascript
     $.when($.ajax("url1"), $.ajax("url2")).done(function(response1, response2) {
       console.log("Both requests complete");
     });
     ```

5. **How does jQuery handle browser compatibility issues?**
   - jQuery abstracts away many cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a unified API to handle different browsers' quirks, allowing developers to write code that works consistently across various browsers.
